# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing the
[project owner](mailto:christopher-hock@protonmail.com). Please provide detailed information about the vulnerability,
including steps to reproduce, possible ways of exploitation and any relevant details about your environment.

We appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Handling of Vulnerabilities

Once a vulnerability is reported, we will review and prioritize it based on its severity. We aim to have a statement
ready as soon as possible and provide updates about its status.

## Dependency Security

We use automated workflows to assess the security of our used dependencies. We recommend to use `cargo audit` to check
dependencies which you may be planning to introduce to the project beforehand to avoid your PR to be rejected.

## Disclaimer

This security policy is subject to change. It is the responsibility of all project contributors and users to stay
updated on any modifications. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this security policy.

Nazara is designed to run only within your local network. The user is responsible for their network setup
themselves.

We are not liable for any damages that are caused by insufficient network security.
