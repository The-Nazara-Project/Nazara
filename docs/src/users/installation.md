# Installation Instructions

You can install Nazara in a bunch of different way.
Our recommended solutions is to either get it from [`crates.io`](https://crates.io/crates/nazara), or
build the latest release from source yourself.

We are currently hard at work to build distribution packages in the future with the first one being
targeted at openSUSE Tumbleweed and SLES15.
