# Nazara Code Style Guide

## General Guide

In regards to formatting, we follow the current Rust code style set by the Cargo formatter (`cargo fmt`).

The easiest way to enforce this, is using `pre-commit` to automatically format and check any code before it is committed.

```admonish info 
This style is enforced by our CI as well. PRs will not be accepted unless the formatting issues are fixed.
```

## Panics

We heavily discourage the use of the `panic!()` macro when aborting the process. Instead, we prefer to handle an error
and abort gracefully with a helpful error message and error code.

We only want to panic, when the issue we encounter is **both catastrophic and unfixable by the user**.

~~~admonish example
These are szenarios in which we **don't want to panic**:

- When input or config parameters are missing
- When connection to NetBox fails
- When an API request returns a different error code that Ok

While we want to panic in these cases:

- When filesystem operations fail
- When Nazara is not run as root
~~~

Instead of panicking, we write custom error types to wrap errors of certain functions and include a well formatted error message alongside the error.
For an exampel on how that looks, please check and of the `error.rs` files found in any of Nazara's packages.

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Example:`src/publisher/error.rs`"
In this example, you can see how we write our custom error types and are able to wrap errors that we receive from other functions
in order to escalate them properly.
```rust
{{#include ../../../src/configuration/error.rs}}
```
~~~

## Focus on Readability

When writing code, we value readability above complexity.

Rust offers a lot of possibilities when it comes to reducing code down into a one-line statement. And that's nice,
and sometimes even necessary.

However, we want to take a **readability first** approach with our codebase. Both to aid maintainability and
increase accessibility for newcomers.

Of course, sometimes using Rust's more "advanced" features will drastically improve performance. So a balance has
to be struck between readability and performance. It is very hard to define a solid policy for this, so 
this is a decision every developer and contributor has to do for themselves and - when necessary - engage
in discussion with maintainers, devs and other contributors about their approach and possible alternatives.

## Documenting Code

For a smilar reason, we encourage devs to properly document their contributions.
This includes but is not limited to:

- Using inline comments to explain possibly hard to understand syntax
- Using Rust's powerful docstring feature to properly document functions, structs and modules
- Adding to this documentation when applicable
- Filling out Issue and PR templates appropriately to aid maintainers review their changes

The following examples will show you an ideal docstring style.

~~~admonish example title="Example: Documenting Functions" collapsible=true
**Documenting Functions:**
```rust
/// This function does X.
///
/// This function does X by doing Y using Z. (Detailed explanation optional)
///
/// # Parameters
/// * `arg: str` - A string argument to process
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(str)` - Returns A, if ...
/// * `Err` - Returns an `ErrType`
pub fn foo(arg: str) -> Result<str, Err> {
 // ...
}
```
While not universally used by all projects, we use `# Parameters` and `# Returns`
sections, especially for larger functions.

If a function does not take arguments, the `# Parameters` section can be omitted.
However, if the function does not return (`!` type) - or returns `()`, this has to be indicated
in the `# Returns` section.

Other sections we use are:

* `# Aborts` - If the function aborts the program. (E.g When input parameters are missing)
* `# Panics` - If the function can cause a `panic!()`.

For both of these sections, list all - or at least the most common - reasons this behaviour can
occur. This can help debugging immensely.

```rust
/// This function does X.
///
/// # Paramters
/// - `path: &str` - The path to a file
///
/// # Returns
/// - `String` - The contents of the file.
///
/// # Aborts
/// This function will exit the process if the file cannot be found.
pub fn read_file(path: &str) -> String {
    match fs::read_to_string(path) {
        Ok(contents) => contents,
        Err(err) => {
            eprintln!("[Error] File '{}' does not exist: {}", path, err);
            process::exit(1);
        }
    }
}
```
~~~

~~~ admonish example title="Example: Documenting Structs" collapsible=true
**Documenting Structs:**
```rust
/// Information about a Person.
pub struct Person {
    /// The name of the Person.
    pub name: String,
    /// The age of the Person.
    pub age: i64,
}
```
It is encouraged to briefly document every field of your struct, whether they are `pub`
or not does not matter.
~~~

~~~ admonish example title="Example: Documenting Modules" collapsible=true
**Documenting Modules:**
```rust
//! This module handles X.
```
You can go into depth here about what a module does. This is encouraged for larger modules.
~~~

~~~admonish hint
Please be aware, that a one-liner docstring above a function **will not suffice**.
Maintainers may ask you to stick to the given format for your contribution.
~~~

We are aware that to some of you, this feels like cluttering the code files.
However, we believe that properly documenting our code is the key to providing a more
inclusive and more maintainable development experience for all.

## Terminal Output/User Interface

When it is necessary to inform the user about a process, we want to make it short, but as expressive as possible.
For this, the following styles apply:

* `Process X has been started...` - Basic white text indicates the current process.
* `\x1b[32m[success]\x1b[0m Something has succeeded` - Green colored `[success]` prefix before the message.
* `\x1b[31m[error]\x1b[0m Something has failed!` - Red colored `[error]` prefix before error message. *This should
automatically be added by our custom error types when they are given a error message.*
* `\áº‹1b[36m[info]\x1b[0m Information level message.` - Light blue colored `[info]` prefix.
* `\x1b[33m[warning]\x1b[0m Something went wrong, but we can continue...` - Yellow colored `[warning]` prefix.

~~~admonish warning
Always remember to close the coloring by resetting the color using the `\x1b[0m` control sequence.
~~~

~~~admonish note collapsible=true
These escape sequences, may not be compatible with all terminals. We are working on a fix as a low priority task.
