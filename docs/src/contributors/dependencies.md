# Dependencies

We only accept external dependencies that:

- Are actively maintained
- Are essential to solving the given issue
- Have permissive or at least compatible licenses (MIT, BSD, LGPL, etc.)
- Are reviewed by maintainers before inclusion

```admonish note
When opening a PR, please put down a reason for including a new dependency.
```

We prefer:
- Zero-dependency alternatives when possible
- Standard library over external packages
