Nazara is an experimental Rust program that automates the collection of system information for NetBox, using NetBox's
API. It enables the automatic creation of new machines in NetBox or population of information fields for existing ones.

**Nazara is in the early stages of its development. Please note that the information listed below is subject to change.**

> [!Note]
> Nazara is currently in a beta state. Bugs are bound to happen. If you encounter any, please [report them](https://github.com/The-Nazara-Project/Nazara/issues).
>
> Furthermore, **Nazara currently does not support custom fields for any NetBox object**. Though, this is the next item on our agenda.

# Compatibility

We strive to make sure to stay compatible with the most recent NetBox version. Here you can see which version of Nazara is compatible with which version of NetBox.
When major ports to newer NetBox versions happen - which usually include breaking changes - the old version of Nazara will be moved to its own branch and tagged accordingly.


| Nazara Version   | NetBox Version | Branch            | maintained?        |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `v0.1.0_beta.2`  | `v4.3.x`       | `main`            | :white_check_mark: |
| `v0.1.0_beta.1`  | `v4.3.x`       | `version/beta-1`  | :white_check_mark: |
| `v0.1.0_alpha.2` | `v3.6.x`       | `version/alpha-2` | :x:                |

Maintenance work on these older versions is not planned.

# Installation

## Building from source

To use Nazara, you will need to have the Rust programming language and `cargo` installed. If you do not have them
installed already, you can follow the instructions provided in the [official Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

*Please note that this program only works on Linux systems.*

Once you have everything installed, you can clone this repository and build the program by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Nazara-Project/Nazara.git
cd Nazara
cargo build --release
```

This will create an executable file in the `target/release` directory.

> [!Important]
> Running Nazara stock will cause it to use our NetBox API reference client library [`thanix_client`](https://github.com/The-Nazara-Project/thanix_client).
> This client was generated from the API spec of a stock NetBox instance (1.x from NetBox v3.6.9 and 2.x from NetBox 4.1.0).
> If you encounter API request issues with your NetBox instance, you may need to generate your own using [`Thanix`](https://github.com/The-Nazara-Project/Thanix).


## Installation via `crates.io`

Nazara is published on `crates.io`. If your operating system permits cargo to install packages globally, simply run `cargo install nazara` to install it.

# Usage

To use Nazara, you will need to configure the URL of your NetBox API and provide an API token to the program by
configuring all of these parameters inside the [configuration file](#configuring-via-nazaraconfigtomlfile).

After that, simply run

```bash
sudo nazara
```

in your terminal. Nazara will automatically collect all required system information and decide whether to create a new device, or update an existing entry.

# Configuration

Nazara supports two ways of providing configuration parameters: CLI arguments and a configuration file.

Nazara accepts these parameters from you:

- `-d, --dry-run`: Print all collected information without committing it to NetBox.
- `-u, --uri <URI>`: URI to your NetBox instance.
- `-t, --token <TOKEN>`: Your API authentication token.
- `-p, --plugin <PLUGIN>`: The path to a plugin script you want to use to fill in custom fields.
- `-h, --help`: Print help.
- `-V, --version`: Print version.

## Configuring via CLI

Here is an example for passing these parameters on using the CLI:

```bash
sudo nazara --uri <API_URL> --token <API_TOKEN> --name test_device
```

When launching Nazara for the first time, a configuration file will be written at `$HOME/.config/nazara/config.toml`. If you pass CLI parameters, these will be automatically
transfered into the config file as well.

## Configuring via `$HOME/.config/nazara/config.toml` (recommended)

Nazara's configuration must be located in the root user's home directory at `$HOME/.config/nazara/config.toml`.

When launching Nazara for the first time, it will write a stock config file to that path.
Certain parameters are required to be configured there manually.
You recognize them by their line not being commented out.

Aside from the NetBox system parameters, configuration` via the `config.toml` also allows you to add certain
custom fields to your system information that cannot be automatically selected. A great example would be the
`System Location` entry. To specify that, simply add the parameter under the `[system]` block in your configuration file.

> [!Note]
> Currently, configuration by config file is the proper way to use Nazara given the amount of data required to register a machine.
> We are investigating possibilities to make this less of a hassle.
> In the meantime, we suggest you copy-paste the config between machines of the same type and function.

For an example config, check out `src/configuration/config_template.toml`

*Please note that the following section is still a work in progress and all information is subject to change.*

## Configuring custom fields using user plugins

Users are able to fill `custom_fields` parameters in their NetBox objects using custom bash scripts.
These scripts should be placed inside the `$HOME/.config/nazara/scripts/` directory.

These scripts can collect the desired information and output *a valid JSON representation* to `stdout`.
Nazara then reads this output, validates it, and attempts to parse it to a `HashMap` of values.

If everything works out, this will populate all of your custom fields no matter what fields you specified, as long as your script
is correct.

> [!Warning]
> Users must make sure that the output of their scripts matches the name of their desired custom fields they specified
> in NetBox.
>
> Currently, **we only support text fields** as all the other field types would require smart parsing on our end.
> We are currently investigating on how to achieve this.
